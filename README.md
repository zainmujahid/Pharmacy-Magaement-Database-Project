## Objective

With this project, our aim was to develop a
comprehensive system that could deal with challenges faced in day to day operation of a modern pharmacy. We studied
the relevant laws and prepared a system that complies with the required Federal and State laws.

## Overview

Pharmacies are essential component of healthcare and handle the function of selling medical drugs. Even though the pharmacies do not seem different than any other shop, their functioning is very different due to various laws regarding drugs.  For example, most of the drugs available in a pharmacy cannot be purchased without a prescription. Even with a signed rescription, there is a limit on the quantity that can be purchased. Additionally, pharmacist can do a background check on customerâ€™s medical history to ensure that they are not involved in drug abuse. In addition, there are other laws on the operations of pharmacy like requirement for safe disposal of expired medicine and equirement of license for employees that mix/prepare the drugs. Thus, preparing a Database Management System for a pharmacy not only requires study of how things are handled from a customer or employee point of view but also the relevant laws.
